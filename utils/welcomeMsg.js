Greetings humans :vulcan:!

I'm building an MVP for Upala Digital Identity. 

Upala provides Sybil-protection for DApps. We score users in DAI. 
As an MVP I want to score all DAOs members outhere (MetaCartel, MolochDAO, etc.) This first identity system based on Upala protocol will be called The BladerunnerDAO:sheep: .

If you are interested please DM, or join our chat.
